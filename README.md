## What This Repository Does Not Contain

- project-specific business logic
- domain knowledge
- user data
- experimental or temporary instructions

All of the above belong in **project-level repositories**, not here.

## Stability and Change Policy

This repository:
- evolves slowly
- changes intentionally
- prioritizes clarity over completeness

Any modification should be minimal, justified, and documented.
